## Redux
### Redux
- A predictable state management library for JS application and the most popular `state` container for React
- The core principles
    1. The `Store` : everything that changes within your application is represented by a single SJ `object` known as the store
        - the store contains our state
    2. Application state is `immutable` : when the app state changes, we clone the state object (in store), modify the clone, and `replace` the original state with the new copy
        - never mutate the original object
        - never write to our store object
    3. `Pure functions` change our state
        - pure functions take in some state and description of what changes took place and return a copy of our state

### React-Redux
- We need a second helper package (`React-Redux`) that will allow us to string together Redux within React because Recus is astandalone library.
    - can also write Redux apps with Angular, Ember, jQuery, or vanilla JS

- Install
```
npm install react-redux redux
```

- Set up the `store`
    - `createStore` : take in a single `reducer` that represents the state 
    ```js
    import { createStore } from 'redux';
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    ```
    - `Provider` : makes the `store` available to any nested component that have been wrapped in the `connect()`
        - will wrap our application and pass the store (just built) as a prop
    ```js
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App/>
    </Provider>
    ```
    - `connect()` : higher order component
    - `mapStateToProps` 

```
Store sets the state ->
Event or user interaction happens ->
An action creator is called and dispatches an action ->
Actions tell us about the changes from the event ->
Reducers handle those actions and replace the store accordingly.
```
